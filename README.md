# Billiards Score App

A minimalistic, mobile-friendly web app for tracking billiards scores.

- Tap near the score number ➜ increment score  
- Tap below the score ➜ decrement score  
- Swipe up/down ➜ increment/decrement  
- Long-press with **1 finger** ➜ reset that side’s score  
- Long-press with **2 fingers** ➜ reset both scores  
- On desktop: **right-click** on a side resets that score (for testing)
